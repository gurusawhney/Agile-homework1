## What I Find Interesting
This article is interesting to me because I worked as a Quantitative Developer for QuantConnect. When working on an open-source platform it is exciting to see how the product gets used. I understand the limitations of the trading engine and it is a great feat that AlphaTrAI was able to implement an AI algorithm that achieved a 58 percent average annual return of capital. During my time as a Quantitative Developer implementing an accurate AI was a challenge and now professionals trust the product enough to trade on it.
